# Research

Broadly, I am interested in developing computational methods to enhance our understanding of evolutionary processes. Specifically I have focused on for Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo

## Bayesian Reconstruction of Cophylogenies

Such cophylogenies are relevant not just to studying coevolution, but also gene treeâ€“species tree evolution.

## Education & Outreach

I believe that phylogenetics is an excellent platform on which to introduce computational science to students. .

Towards this ends, I am currently preparing [a website](//www.ithinktree.org/) aimed at introducing high school students to phylogenetics and providing instructional materials so that they may conduct their own research using phylogenetic methods.

I believe that phylogenetics is an excellent platform on which to introduce computational science to students. I was first introduced to phylogenetics in a high school classroom and within a few months was doing a science fair project on the history of the HIV/AIDS virus. These initial experiences substantially encouraged my interest in science as a career.

As a highly interdisciplinary field, phylogenetics appeals to students with a wide variety of interests in biology, computer science, and mathematics, or even the social sciences considering that epidemiology has important connections to human history. One of the main advantages of computational methods is that it opens doors to research topics that are not normally available to secondary-level students, such as infectious diseases. In general, research today is becoming heavily dependent on computers,  is valuable to a future career in science.

It turns out that much of the infrastructure for phylogenetics as an educational platform is already in place: all of the necessary materials are openly accessible to anyone with an internet connection, including genetic data, software, and even supercomputer resources on which to run analyses (thanks to the [CIPRES project](//www.phylo.org/)). This means that even communities with limited resources can potentially implement a phylogenetics curriculum.
