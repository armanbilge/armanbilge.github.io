## About the website 

This is a [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/)-generated website hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). It uses a mildly-customized [*minimal* theme](http://github.com/orderedlist/minimal). Photo galleries implement the [Lightbox2](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) library and are automatically created with a custom Liquid template. All image files are stored on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3).
