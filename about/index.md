# About Me

![Me](me.jpg)

I am a first year undergraduate at
[The University of Auckland](//auckland.ac.nz/), New Zealand,
where I am studying computer science and biology.
I grew up in the Greater Boston area
and am an avid photographer of New England's flora and fauna.
During high school
I discovered the interdisciplinary field of computational biology
and had the opportunity to work on projects in this area with groups at
[Harvard](//www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/girguis/)
and [MIT](//compbio.mit.edu/).
After I was awarded a scholarship by the
[Siemens Foundation](//www.siemens-foundation.org/en/competition/2013_winners.htm)
in 2013, I followed my research interests to the
[Computational Evolution Group](//compevol.auckland.ac.nz/) at UoA,
where I am currently developing software to study coevolutionary systems.

## Colophon

This is a [Jekyll](//www.jekyllrb.com/)-generated website
hosted on [Amazon S3](//aws.amazon.com/s3).
It uses a mildly customized [*minimal* theme](//github.com/orderedlist/minimal).
Photo galleries implement the
[Lightbox2](//lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) library
and are automatically created with a custom Liquid template.
