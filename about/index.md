# About Me

![Me](me.jpg)

I am a computational evolutionary biologist specializing in statistical phylogenetics.
Growing up in the Greater Boston area, I discovered the interdisciplinary field of computational biology as a high school student and had the opportunity to work with groups at [Harvard](//girguislab.oeb.harvard.edu) and [MIT](//compbio.mit.edu/).
After I was awarded a scholarship by the [Siemens Foundation](//web.archive.org/web/20140906134706id_/http://www.siemens-foundation.org/en/competition/2013_winners.htm#3) in 2013, I followed my research interests to the [Centre for Computational Evolution](//compevol.auckland.ac.nz/) at [The University of Auckland](//auckland.ac.nz/).
From September 2016 to December 2017 I was a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](//www.stat.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](//washington.edu/) working with the [Matsen Group](//matsen.group/) at [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](//fredhutch.org/).

This is a [Jekyll](//www.jekyllrb.com/)-generated website hosted on [Amazon S3](//aws.amazon.com/s3).
It uses a mildly customized [*minimal* theme](//github.com/orderedlist/minimal).
Photo galleries implement the [Lightbox2](//lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) library and are automatically created with a custom Liquid template.
