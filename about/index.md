# About Me

![Me](me.jpg)

I am a first year undergraduate at [The University of Auckland](http://auckland.ac.nz/), New Zealand, where I am studying computer science and biology. I grew up in the Greater Boston area and became an avid photographer of the flora and fauna of New England. During high school, I discovered the interdisciplinary field of computational biology and had the opportunity to work on projects in this area with groups at [Harvard](http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/girguis/) and [MIT](http://compbio.mit.edu/). After being awarded a scholarship by the [Siemens Foundation](http://www.siemens-foundation.org/en/competition/2013_winners.htm) in 2013, I followed my research interests to the [Computational Evolution Group](http://compevol.auckland.ac.nz/) at UoA, where I am continuing my work on a computer model for coevolutionary phenomenon.

## Colophon 

This is a [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/)-generated website hosted on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3). It uses a mildly customized [*minimal* theme](http://github.com/orderedlist/minimal). Photo galleries implement the [Lightbox2](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) library and are automatically created with a custom Liquid template.
