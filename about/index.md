# About Me

![Me](me.jpg)

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](//www.stat.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](//washington.edu/), where I am developing next-generation methods for [Bayesian phylogenetic inference](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference_in_phylogeny/) with the [Matsen Group](//matsen.group/) at [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](//fredhutch.org/).
I grew up in the Greater Boston area and am an [avid photographer](/photos/) of New England's flora and fauna.
During high school I discovered the interdisciplinary field of computational biology and had the opportunity to work on projects in this area with groups at [Harvard](//www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/girguis/) and [MIT](//compbio.mit.edu/).
After I was awarded a scholarship by the [Siemens Foundation](//web.archive.org/web/20140906134706id_/http://www.siemens-foundation.org/en/competition/2013_winners.htm#3) in 2013, I followed my research interests to the [Centre for Computational Evolution](//compevol.auckland.ac.nz/) at [The University of Auckland](//auckland.ac.nz/) where I was involved with a number of projects.
In September 2016, I started my Ph.D. in statistics at UW.

This is a [Jekyll](//www.jekyllrb.com/)-generated website hosted on [Amazon S3](//aws.amazon.com/s3).
It uses a mildly customized [*minimal* theme](//github.com/orderedlist/minimal).
Photo galleries implement the [Lightbox2](//lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) library and are automatically created with a custom Liquid template.
